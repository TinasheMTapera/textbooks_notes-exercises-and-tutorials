# Textbook Tracker

This repo tracks any code related to the textbooks I read for my own benefit
(i.e. excluding classroom-mandated learning). Use this to take notes,
keep track of code that is helpful or insightful, try out packages, 
do `hello world` demos of tutorials, etc., either informally or formally. If possible, directories are
submodule forked repos of the original book's HTML.
