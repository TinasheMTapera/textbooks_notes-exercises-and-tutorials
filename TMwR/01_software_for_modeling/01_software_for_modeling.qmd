Definition: Models are mathematical tools that can describe a system and capture relationships in the data given to them
:::

- The utility of a model hinges on its ability to be reductive, or to reduce complex relationships to simpler terms.

## Types of Models

1. _Descriptive models_: To describe or illustrate characteristics of data. e.g. visually
emphasise a trend or artifact

2. _Inferential models_: To produce a decision for a research question or to explore a specific hypothesis, similar to how statistical tests are used (remember t-tests & ANOVA are GLMs)

Inferential mode starts with an assumption about a population, then
produces a statistical conclusion to confirm or reject that
assumption.

Ultimately, a model for statistical inference posits: "If my data were truly independent (unbiased), and we fit a model to it, and the residuals of that model follow a known distribution X, then test statistic Y can be used to produce a p-value. Otherwise, the resulting p-value might be inaccurate."

3. _Predictive models_: The primary goal is that the predicted values have the highest possible fidelity to the true value of the new data.

There are two approaches â€” mechanistic (known mechanisms of first principles a priori, like knowing how to model effort by knowing it's a combination of reward and risk) or empirical, where the model is defined only by the structure of the prediction

These can be lumped into supervised (known outcome, e.g. regression or classification) and unsupervised (no known outcome, e.g. pattern or cluster analysis)
